                                                            <h4>Layout</h4>
                                                            <p>You can design the layout to suit your needs however please ensure everyone can see a projector for pitches/presentations. Also need freeform movable tables and chairs for hacktivity.</p>

                                                            <h4>Accessibility</h4>
                                                            <p>Make sure the venue is accessible by people with extra mobility requirements. At the very least ensure that someone using a mobility scooter / wheelchair / similar can get into the building, get to the hacking, get to the bathroom, and deliver a presentation.</p>

                                                            <h4>Catering</h4>
                                                            <p>Some venues of a more conference-y nature will require you to use in-house catering. This generally makes things easier, but also tends to be fairly pricey. It's also worth ensuring that they're around for both days of the weekend. If catering isn't contractually constrained, the minimal quality recommended is ordering from a local M&S or similar.</p>

                                                            <h4>Refreshments</h4>
                                                            <p>NHS Hack Day has a healthy-eating policy. So none of the "traditional" hack day fare of pizza and Red Bull, or similar. Basically you want a "healthy lunch" for both days (don't forget about vegetarians, and it's probably worth lobbying in some vegan provision if you can - consider asking at signup about dietary requirements), plus hydration - coffee and tea and water are pretty essential; you'll want these constantly flowing throughout both days.</p>
                                                            <p><b>High-bandwidth coffee provision is rather useful, as is avoiding instant coffee if possible.</b></p>

                                                            <h4>Power</h4>
                                                            <p>Strong preference for venues with electrical power. NHS Hack Day owns a collection of power cables. These were helpfully branded with London Python Dojo stickers by @ntoll so you can recognise them. Someone will have them in a box. Ask on the organizers list to find out who lugged them home last time.</p>

                                                            <h4>WiFi</h4>
                                                            <p>Inevitably there is not enough internet. Inevitably venues will underestimate how much you need in the way of internet. Make it clear to them that this is not "200ish people turning up to sit quietly as someone talks", this is "200ish people each turning up with multiple devices making heavy use of the network".</p>

                                                            <p>Ensure that you will have access to the wifi (in a previous NHSHD, "wifi" meant some BT-pay-five-pounds-to-use thing, which was fairly bad) and that you know what the terms are (often it's "we will generate you disposable guest tokens" in which case get many, people will inevitably lose them between days / sometimes they'll be tied to a day; it may also be "we need the names of everyone attending and will issue them individually a guest token")</p>

                                                            <p>In the case of access codes/tokens, do try to allocate them and print them on name badges. People lose name badges less often than bits of paper with random hex strings on them.</p>

                                                            <p>Wired internet is preferable to no internet, but not ideal; it limits people's movement and creates potential trip hazards - it's better than no internet though.</p>

                                                            <p>It's the people who really make the event, so it's important to ensure that we get good people to come along. Diversity is key. It is not just for "doctors and developers". While the bulk of attendees tend to be either professional software developers or medical students / junior doctors, that's more due to the ease of reaching those groups. Don't forget about nurses, therapists, patients, statisticians, designers, mathematicians, et cetera. One of the best things about NHSHD is the amount that attendees learn from each other.</p>

                                                            <p><b>Essentially, if someone's interested in helping make the NHS better, that's all we need. Everyone is welcome.</b></p>

                                                            <p>During signup, you'll want to capture information about people's backgrounds/abilities to make sure you have a balanced group. One organiser found that a text field labelled "Are you medical, technical, both or other?" managed to be quite inclusive and useful. It's not quantitative, but was still very useful for working out groups to target.</p>

                                                            <p>Diversity along other axes is also important. Particularly among the technical participants, it's very easy to end up with a disproportionate majority of straight white dudes. Use creative links and hashtags to spread the word, see promotions for more ideas.</p>

                                                            <p>Like attendees, a diverse panel of judges is good. Keeping the group small is good; aim for 3-6. Too few and you don't get enough points of view; too many and it becomes unwieldy and slow. The judging panel is a good way to get NHSHD exposed to various senior medical types, so these are probably who you want to focus on getting to volunteer. Make sure you give them enough notice; they tend to be busy people.</p>

                                                            <p>Make sure that you have technical representation on the panel. This is particularly useful in ensuring that material achievement of projects is correctly factored in.</p>

                                                            <p>Things we are not willing to do for sponsors:</p>

                                                            <ul>
                                                            <li>Give them direct email access to attendees</li>
                                                            <li>Let them speak/pitch at the event</li>
                                                            </ul>

                                                            <p>Basically while we couldn't run the event without sponsors, and we're very grateful for their support, we don't want a "corporate" feel. Also from a sponsor perspective, it's a highly heterogenous audience, so "blanket outreach" is unlikely to do them much good anyway. We have also in the past actively refused sponsorship from organisations whose values we felt didn't align with those of the hack day as a whole.</p>

                                                            <p>What this tends to mean is that the best sponsors tend to be NHS organisations and small to medium tech companies who work with open source. They tend to be very light-handed on the publicity desires, while being exactly the kinds of partners we'd like to publicise through NHS Hack Day. It is recommended to check with Open Healthcare UK before approaching / accepting sponsors.</p>

                                                            <p>Within reason. It is not the Coca Cola NHS Hack Day.</p>
